QuickStart
==========

Before starting, just a remind of what RedBaron is and is not:

* Baron is producing a FST in form of a big JSON out of a valid python source file and JSON of that size is boring to work with
* RedBaron is a tool build to make working with this JSON way easier by providing an interface heavily inspired by BeautifulSoup, allowing to query and modify it.
* **It is not a refactoring library**. But it allows you to write one way more easier that anything else I'm aware off.

This quickstart will teach you first: how to query the Baron FST using
RedBaron, then: how to modify it.
